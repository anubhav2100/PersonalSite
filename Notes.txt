/** CSS **/
--> there ae three types of css inline css , internal CSS and external CSS
Colorunt.io povides us with good color
Inline CSS we can do  this by using going line by line and implementing
Extenal CSS --> We can do  this by using styles tag like we can create a style tag and start implementing the same
Deafult CSS --> some css which browser applied to our website
**--> We cant change the dimension of body as it is blocked
--> for a dotted border line we can use  (border-style dotted)
--> background color will change the box color and color simply just hchange the text color this is the diff to note
--> how to debug CSS Use devloper tools and console to use this and figure it out
**--> Inline CSS > Internal CSS >  External CSS
--> Anatomy Of Css syntax   -->  selector{property:value;}  --> selector -> who , property ->  what , value -> how;
--> id are unique where classes are unique and both overrides default size or parent styles
--> .ClassName{
  propety:color;
}
--> #IdName{
  property:color;
}
/** ADVANCED CSS */

Favicon --> show up in browser (favicon. cc) is the website we will use this to create our favicons
--> For underline we do text-decoration : underlined;

** DIVS -->
They help us to divide our content into blocks
we can also define borders for our borders
padding space between border and content
margin is the buffer zone  So rememer four thing margin--> border--> padding -->content;
margin gives us space from the another elements it just gives us space.

--> CSS Display property
1) Block elements take the whole width of the screen  and eg--> <p> , <div> , <form> ,<h1> to <h6> and list items
like <ol> <li> <ul>
** span helps us to selects one part of the element and let us style it differently
2) Inline Elements Jitna space chahiye utna hi lete hai eg--> span,images,<a>
we cant change the width of the inline element
--> and we can also change the display property from inline to lock and vice versa
3) Inline block they are inline also and block elements also best of all and we can also change the property
4) None removes the element form the website Eg hiding quiz
and we can also do this by the property visiility : hidden;

-->  Relative Postioning  It moves our object relative to the earlier position  and to do this we do {position: Relative;} agar left toh right top toh bottom jayega vicevesa
--> Absolute Positioning it moves our element relative to the body and to do this {position:absolute;}

--> Centeing Elements  We wnat to center our element in our website so we can use text-align It does not work for bock element or if it's width is set then we will use auto
eg: margin: 0 auto 0 auto;

--> Font Sytling We have taken the help of the google font bascillt two types ine is serif and the other is sans serif
and also we have added a link to make this all happen
we can look to our website flaticon
--> Font weight tell specifies the boldness of the font
--> Line Width helps us to specify the space between the lines.


---> FLoat and clear clear is the anti float  by using float we can left align and ight align
